					<h1>Services</h1>
					<p>Working with both venture capital seeking and venture backed companies, KCG offers financial, accounting and operational support in three key function areas: Interim CFO, Full Service Accounting/Controller and Human Resources/Operations.</p>
					<h2>KCG Interim CFO Services</h2>
					<p>For emerging technology growth companies, KCG's managing partner, Ryan Keating becomes a fully integrated member of the client's executive management team with particular focus on in the creation of KCG's financial modeling for the purposes raising of a round, acquisition, Board meetings and due diligence. Further, an interim CFO can develop the required tools necessary for potential investors, Board members and executive management to guide in making informed next-step decisions.</p>
					<h2>Full Service Controller and Accounting Services</h2>
					<p>The KCG accounting team is an experienced group of controllers, CPAs and bookkeepers who manage day-to-day business functions including: accounting, AR/AP, planning and purchasing. We are routinely involved with special projects such as audit coordination, compliance, revenue recognition, tax issues, and due diligence for funding and acquisition.</p>
					<p>Beyond the basic maintenance of the daily accounting and controller activities, KCG implements accounting systems, tax preparation, as well as supervision and training of existing staff&mdash;all cornerstone elements important to building a fully functioning accounting department.</p>
					<h2>Human Resources and Operations</h2>
					<p>By providing its HR and Operations support services, KCG helps establish and build the HR function by generating benefit packages, employee handbooks and company policies and procedures, benefits and payroll.  We also offer support with employee relations&mdash;including new hire orientation, reduction in force/termination, PTO tracking, worker's comp, grievances and leave of absences. Finally, we help establish and maintain employee stock option plans and awards.</p>
					<p>Operations support consists of administrative and facilities related functions. We can assist in administrative assistance to executive staff such as expense reporting, travel logistics and calendar maintenance.</p>
